# Operation ID Tracing

Every operation (CLI command, batch process, scheduled task) should generate a unique operation ID that appears in all related log entries. This enables complete tracing of an operation from start to finish.

## Operation ID Format

```
{operation_name}_{YYYYMMDD}_{HHMMSS}_{short_uuid}
```

**Examples:**
- `receipts_process_20251011_182001_a3d5e8f4`
- `transactions_import_20251011_143022_b7f3d9e1`
- `sync_all_20251011_090000_c8e4a0f2`

**Components:**
- `operation_name`: Human-readable operation identifier (snake_case)
- `YYYYMMDD`: Date stamp for quick identification
- `HHMMSS`: Time stamp for uniqueness
- `short_uuid`: First 8 chars of UUID4 for guaranteed uniqueness

## Generation

Use the helper function:

```python
from manchego.utils.logging_helpers import generate_operation_id

operation_id = generate_operation_id("process_files")
# Returns: "process_files_20251011_182001_a3d5e8f4"
```

## When to Generate vs When to Pass

### Generate at Entry Points

Generate operation_id at the **entry point** of an operation:

✅ **Always generate at:**
- **CLI command entry** (`@app.command()` functions) - ALWAYS new
- **Scheduled task entry points** - ALWAYS new
- **API endpoint handlers** (future) - ALWAYS new
- **Top-level operations when called directly** - Auto-generate if None

❌ **Never generate at:**
- Helper functions (they must receive operation_id)
- Nested operations (reuse parent's operation_id)
- Library/utility functions (receive operation_id)

### Pattern: CLI Commands (Always Generate)

CLI commands ALWAYS generate a new operation_id:

```python
@app.command("process")
def process_cmd():
    # ALWAYS generate - this is the entry point
    operation_id = generate_operation_id("dataset_process")
    result = process_files(operation_id=operation_id)  # Pass it down
```

### Pattern: Business Functions (Accept + Auto-Generate)

Business functions accept operation_id but auto-generate if None:

```python
def process_files(operation_id: str | None = None):
    # Auto-generate if called directly (not from CLI)
    if operation_id is None:
        operation_id = generate_operation_id("process_files")
    
    # Now use operation_id in all logs and pass to helpers
    log_operation_start(logger, "process_files", operation_id)
    
    for file in files:
        process_file(file, operation_id)  # Pass it down
```

### Pattern: Helper Functions (Always Receive)

Helper functions ALWAYS receive operation_id (never generate):

```python
def process_file(file: Path, operation_id: str):
    # Never generate - always receive from caller
    logger.info("Processing file", extra={
        "operation_id": operation_id,
        "data": {"file": file.name}
    })
```

### Decision Tree

```
Is this a CLI command?
├─ YES → ALWAYS generate new operation_id
└─ NO → Is this a top-level business function?
    ├─ YES → Accept operation_id parameter (optional)
    │        └─ Auto-generate if None
    └─ NO → Is this a helper/utility function?
        └─ YES → Receive operation_id (required parameter)
                 └─ NEVER generate
```

## Propagation Pattern

Pass operation_id down the call stack:

```python
# CLI entry point - generate here
@app.command("process")
def process_cmd():
    operation_id = generate_operation_id("dataset_process")
    result = process_files(operation_id=operation_id)

# Business function - receive and use
def process_files(operation_id: str | None = None) -> dict:
    if operation_id is None:
        operation_id = generate_operation_id("process_files")
    
    log_operation_start(logger, "process_files", operation_id)
    
    for file in files:
        process_single_file(file, operation_id)

# Helper function - receive and use
def process_single_file(file: Path, operation_id: str):
    logger.info("Processing file", extra={
        "operation_id": operation_id,
        "data": {"file": file.name}
    })
```

## Optional Parameter Pattern

Make operation_id optional with auto-generation fallback:

```python
def process_files(
    limit: int | None = None,
    operation_id: str | None = None
) -> dict:
    """Process files from input directory.
    
    Args:
        limit: Maximum number of files to process
        operation_id: Operation ID for log tracing (auto-generated if None)
    """
    if operation_id is None:
        operation_id = generate_operation_id("process_files")
    
    # Use operation_id in all logs
```

This allows:
- CLI commands to pass operation_id (for full tracing)
- Direct function calls to work without operation_id (auto-generated)

## Including in Logs

All log entries should include operation_id in the `extra` parameter:

```python
logger.info("Operation started", extra={
    "operation_id": operation_id,
    "data": {"limit": 50}
})

logger.error("Operation failed", extra={
    "operation_id": operation_id,
    "error": {"type": "ValueError", "message": "Invalid input"}
})
```

The JSON formatter will extract operation_id to a top-level field:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-11T18:20:01.234Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "module": "manchego.dataset.process",
  "operation_id": "dataset_process_20251011_182001_a3d5e8f4",
  "message": "Operation started",
  "data": {"limit": 50}
}
```

## Querying by Operation ID

Machine-readable logs enable easy querying:

```bash
# Get all logs for a specific operation
jq 'select(.operation_id == "dataset_process_20251011_182001_a3d5e8f4")' data/logs/dataset/*.log

# Show timeline of an operation
jq -r 'select(.operation_id == "dataset_process_20251011_182001_a3d5e8f4") | "\(.timestamp) [\(.level)] \(.message)"' data/logs/**/*.log | sort
```

## Benefits

- **Complete tracing**: Follow a single operation across all modules and log files
- **Debugging**: Isolate logs for a specific command or batch process
- **Correlation**: Link CLI commands to module operations
- **Performance**: Measure end-to-end operation duration
- **Parallel operations**: Distinguish between concurrent operations
